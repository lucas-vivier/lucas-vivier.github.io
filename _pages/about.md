I am a PhD scholar in Economics specializing in the energy sector, currently working as a consultant for the World Bank. I bring +6 years of experience in the energy sector, spanning both academia and industry.
My research focuses on Energy Efficiency Economics. 
* I assess demand-side policies when accounting for multiple market and behavioral frictions.
* I develop innovative bottom-up modeling framworks to assess policies in the energy sector. Code are released open-source and available on my [GitHub page](https://github.com/lucas-vivier).
* Some of these models has been used by authorities in their own assessment of the residential sector's contribution to low-carbon strategy.
